# Exploratory Data Analysis on an IMDB movie Dataset

### Problem Statement
Trying to find some interesting insights into a few movies released between 1916 and 2016, using Python. Python functions like concatenation, dropping, sorting, grouping, etc. have been used to gather the insights.

#### Inspection and Cleaning of Data

Have inspected shape and datatypes of all variables in the dataset. Checked number of null values per column.\
After that, I have dropped the columns and rows with high percentages of null values(greater than 5%).
Also, filled the remaining nulls in the 'Language' column with English.
There were some duplicate values in the data as well, I dropped those duplicates.
After all of these steps, still retained 77% of our original data.
